# Internet and MVC

## Objectives

* Ability to add multiple controllers
  - We need to make sure we inherit from `ApplicationController`
  - We need to make sure that our `config.ru` says `use <ControllerName>` for all controllers. EXCEPT we `run ApplicationController` and that must be the last line
* Understand how params work and how to create new data
* Manipulate data already existing in our database to UPDATE data
