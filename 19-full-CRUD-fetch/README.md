# Full CRUD + fetch

## Learning Goals

* Explain what a SPA is
* Build out full CRUD in our app using fetch
* Manipulate the DOM in conjunction with our CRUD fetch calls
  * Optimistic Rendering vs Promise Callback
* If time... One unrelated mind-blowing discovery. ðŸ¤¯ (atom)


## New Features To Build
* As a user, I want my app to look more professional (add some flavor *FAKE*)
* As a user, I should be able create new books and it should update the database
* As a user, I should be able to check out books and it should update the database
* As a user, I should be able to return my books and it should update the database
* As a user, I should be able to delete any book and it should update the database (!!NEW FEATURE ALERT!!)
